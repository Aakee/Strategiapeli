# Strategiapeli

or Strategy Game in English

## About the repository

This repository includes a project work conducted on Spring 2017 on a Python programming course at Aalto University (Basic Course in Programming Y2, CS-A1121). It is a Fire Emblem -like strategy game between a player and computer: both players play turn-wise controlling all their characters with different abilities, attacks, and stats, with the aim of defeating all enemy units. The code is mainly how it was back when I finished the project in May 2017, with all its ups and faults.

The documentation, as well as some in-game text, is written in Finnish.


## Dependencies

The game needs PyQt5 to run. You can install it with
  `python -m pip install pyqt5`
(or similar).

## How to run

Change the working directory to src, and run the script main.py.

## Game rules and documentation

You can find the documentation in /"Suunnitelmat & dokumentointi", though in Finnish.
